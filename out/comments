Today's MA graphs (7/27):  The single graph was getting too cluttered so I separated it out, and also am plotting the positive test rate.

The new cases is still drifting up (near 200/day).  

The positive test rate is holding even at about 2% per day and that's held nearly flat since mid June.  So the upward drift in new cases is really a flattening of new cases but increased testing.   It's not good that the new cases are flat, but it's better than if they were really increasing.   I wouldn't call this "under control".

Hospitalizations are still improving.

New deaths are probably holding steady near 15/day.  I think we cannot consider it under control until new deaths are down to 3/day  (and maybe lower).  So we are at least a factor of 5 away from "under control".

Long-term-care facility (LTCF) cases are on the rise, and deaths are flat.   This seems unlikely to be about testing, since the LTCF cases were already aggressively tested.
